                Nurse gone web dev! 
                <br /> I've been a Registered Nurse for four years. This has allowed me time to develop excellent communication and teamwork skills that will cross over well in the field of web development. I completed the Ohio State University Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp in July 2022, and I'm looking for opportunities to showcase my skills and continue learning. 
                <br /> My skillset includes: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, Node.js, Express.js, SQL, noSQL (GraphQL), React, and MongoDB (MERN stack).
